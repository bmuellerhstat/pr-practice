## Mr. Mueller's Ideal Afternoon

The best way to relax after a long day is to eat ice cream and watch a movie.

Another good way to relax is too sit in front a window while its raining or whenever, put on some headphones, listen to music, close our eyes, think about whatever, and breathe. (this alwasy makes my relax the most)

The best ice cream is mint chocolate chip.
No icecream is superior, its just your opinion :D
