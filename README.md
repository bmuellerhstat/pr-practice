## Mr. Mueller's Ideal Afternoon

The best way to relax after a long day is to eat ice cream and watch a movie.

The best ice cream is mint chocolate chip.

MINT CHOCOLATE CHIP ICECREAM IS THE WORST FLAVOURRRRRR!!!!
(Mr. Mueller, don't hate me for this... I think I'm allergic to that flavour. SORRY)
