## Mr. Mueller's Ideal Afternoon

The best way to relax after a long day is to eat ice cream and watch a movie.
I disagree, instead the best way to relax after a long day is to take a shower, and drink some pimping hot chocolate drink and take a nap in your bed. And of course git status to see how you are doing :)

The best ice cream is mint chocolate chip.
Haha, nice one but I think vanilla and strawberry favorite ice cream is better
