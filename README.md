## Mr. Mueller's Ideal Afternoon

The best way to relax after a long day of work is to eat ice cream and take a nap.

The best ice cream is matcha ice cream.

The ideal time to eat ice cream is in the summer.

Ice cream is cold.

The best time to take a nap is in the afternoon.

Taking naps are refreshing and reset your mind.
